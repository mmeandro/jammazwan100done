# This is an entire eclipse workspace of 100 camel projects:

  * git clone as an entire folder, not inside another eclipse workspace
  * open this folder as an eclipse workspace
  * import all 100 projects as existing eclipse projects 
  * (if intellij or another IDE import as maven projects)

# This is not production code:

  * Meant to show one possible path to completion only
  * Some jammazwan specs may not be fullfilled to the exact letter
  * Most of these solutions were derived in part from the excellent book "Camel In Action" by Claus Isben. All credit goes to him for anything good, all blame goes to Pete Carapetyan for anything less than excellent.
