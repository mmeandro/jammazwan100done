Goals:
- push your skills past your Camel comfort zone
- increase your speed and agility through reps
- provide minimal example boilerplate so you can focus on value-add skills
	
PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
    - default to the normal exception handling provided
    - use mocks to confirm that recipients and/or messages conform to expectations
PSEUDOCODE FOR ROUTES
    - template.sendBody([some String by you]) FROM INSIDE JUNIT TEST
    [1st route]
    - your message body is now a simple string
    - to direct endpoint
    [2nd route]
    - from direct endpoint
    - FTP this to a named folder, using the file name of 'Important', suffixed with a timestamp, and '.txt'
FOR EXTRA CREDIT:
    - modify to create your camel contex in java
    - add a script, or manually if only option, deploying to a Docker engine
    - write your routes in java, unless you already did in your first pass
